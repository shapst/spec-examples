## System Requirements

### Stakeholders

This section describes key stakeholders of the system and their architectural concerns.

* **SH-1**: **Administrator** (security)
    - security is the second name for an administrator; these people deal with user accounts and the billing system.

* **SH-2**: **Account** (availability, performance, scalability, robustness)
    - accounts want the system they're accessing is available anytime they want to use it, and that it responses quickly
      to their actions;

* **SH-3**: **Employer** (availability, performance, scalability, robustness)
    - employers want to track clear and transparent hiring process for their job postings.

* **SH-4**: **Job seeker** (availability, performance, scalability, robustness)
    - job-seekers want to track clear and transparent hiring process.

* **SH-5**: **Visitor** (availability, performance, scalability, robustness)
    - Visitors want to have access job postings and public pages;
    - Don't need to sign-up and sign-in;

## Baseline Architecture
---
This section describes the architecture of the current jobmarket system.

Please note that all views are documented in C4 model style, although only System Context, Container and dynamic views
are presented. The most diagrams use informal notation style. All diagrams are supplied with a key explaining meaning of
each shape on the diagram.

The following diagram depicts the containers diagram of the current system:

![Baseline Architecture](images/C4-system-context.jpg "Baseline Architecture")

## Containers

The containers diagram that follows shows the high-level shape of the software architecture and how responsibilities are
distributed across containers.
It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate with one another.

[DROPPED]

## Process Views

This section explains some key use cases to demonstrate how corresponding workflows pass through containers.

### UC-1: Account registration

The following sequence diagram highlights some key requests that the account performs during registration in the system.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor u as User
    participant app as Application
    participant account as Account Service
    app->>u: Request email address and password
    u->>app: User enters an email, password and confirm password
    app->>app: Verify password and confirm password are equal
    app->>+account: Create a new account
    account-->>account: Verify account data
    account-->>+app: [500] If the email is already registered
    account-->>account: Create disabled account
    account->>-account: Generate confirmation token and send by email
    account-->>+u: Confirmation token to confirm email and activate account
    account-->>+app: [200] Created Account ID
    u->>app: User enters the confirmation token
    app-->>+account: Verify the confirmation token
    alt valid token
        account-->>account: Enable account
        account-->>+app: [200] Send access token and refresh token
        app-->>-u: Store authentication tokens
    else broken or expired token
        account-->>+app: [401] Security exception
        app-->>-u: Authentication error
    end
```

### UC-2: Account sign in

The following sequence diagram highlights some key requests that the account performs during sign in the system.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor u as User
    participant app as Application
    participant account as Account Service
    app->>u: Request email address, password
    u->>app: User enters an email and password
    app->>+account: Verify usersâ€™ credentials
    account-->>account: Confirms that the provided credentials are valid
    alt valid credentials
      account->>-account: Generate access token and refresh token
      account-->>+app: [200] Access token and refresh token
      app->>u: The system logs the user in
    else invalid credentials or account disabled
      account-->>+app: [401] Credentials are not valid or account is not active
      app->>u: The system deny the user in
    end
    
```
