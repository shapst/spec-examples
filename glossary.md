## Job position
A job position is a function you serve at a company. 
It includes the daily tasks and projects you complete. 
Every employee has a job position that includes specific duties and responsibilities that help the company reach its goals.
Over time, you understand your job position more because you become familiar with daily work. 

Job positions vary from business to business and even change over time while still at the same company. 
For example, you might gain more responsibilities in the same position after earning a raise. 
If you earn a promotion, your position and title change to reflect your new duties.

### Job title vs. job position
There are a few distinctions between a job position and a job title. 
A job title is a label your company gives you, while a job position describes your responsibilities.
When including your job positions on your resume, it's important to list your everyday tasks to give the
hiring manager a clear idea of your duties. Each candidate with the same job position defines 
their work slightly differently. This distinction is because companies vary in the type of work they provide employees.


# Jobseeker Vs Candidate – What’s The Difference?
While many hiring managers and human resources may use the term “Applicants” and “Candidates” interchangeably, they have very different meanings in the recruiting world. You may also hear your recruiter use the terms “Talent” and “Passive Candidates.” When it comes to hiring, it’s essential to understand what these terms mean and why they are important.

## Job Seeker
A job seeker is a person who is actively looking for a job.

## Candidate
A candidate is an individual who is being considered for a particular job opportunity.

## Talent
Talent is an alternative term used for candidates or applicants.

## Applicant
A person who applies for a job, by sending in their resume, completing a job application form, or by other means.

## Active Job Search
An individual who is actively engaged in looking for a new job is conducting an “Active Job Search.” They are spending time preparing their resume, compiling a list of target companies, searching for job openings, making connections, and submitting their resumes. This term can apply to both employed and unemployed job seekers. It is often used to juxtapose a “Passive Job Search” or “Passive Candidate”.

## Passive candidate
A passive candidate is typically currently employed and not actively looking for a new job but would be open to a new job if the right job were presented to them. This person may be targeted for a specific position by a headhunter or a recruiter. They may also occasionally browse job search engines for potential new employment opportunities.
